//LTV3 Playlist Pre-Release Tool//"
	
This script is designed to update the packages.cssc file
and create the .packages.cssc.md5sum required for reconciling
It requires two arguments, a .zip filename and a description.

The script will append your campaign to the end of the current 
packages.cssc file.

This tool is specifically designed for fringe testing use, when manually side loading playlists is insufficient.

Pre Requisites:
	This script must be run on a Linux environment, Cygwin will suffice for Windows.
	
	The md5_calc.php file must be present in the current working directory.
	
	This script only UPDATES the pacakges.cssc file. A version of packages.cssc needs to exist in the working directory to function. 
	
	A valid playlists zip (no folder within folder, etc) is required.
	
Once the process is complete, copy the playlist zip, the packages.cssc file and the .packages.cssc.md5sum file to 
/content/dist/continental/ on the LAB WADL (172.16.36.94)
